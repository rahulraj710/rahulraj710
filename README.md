### Hello, I'm Rahul Raj
I'm a software engineer with over 6 years of professional experience, and I recently earned a master’s degree from Columbus State University. I specialize in backend development using Java and Python, and have hands-on experience delivering scalable systems and APIs across diverse projects.

## Professional Highlights
Built and maintained enterprise-grade web applications using Java, Django Rest Framework, and Python.
Delivered new features, resolved complex bugs, and optimized application performance in production environments.
Mentored junior engineers and conducted training for new hires and end users.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams and followed industry best practices using Git, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Currently Expanding My Skills In
Spring Boot – to deepen backend microservice development expertise.
ReactJS – to build interactive and responsive front-end interfaces.

I’m actively building new projects to apply what I’m learning—many of which will be added here soon. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don’t hesitate to connect if you're interested in collaborating.
