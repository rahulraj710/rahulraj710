Hello, I'm Rahul Raj, currently pursuing a master's degree at Columbus State University. With over 5 years of professional experience as a software developer, I specialize in Python and Java.
During my career, I have contributed to various projects, including web applications built with Java and REST APIS based on Django Rest Framework.
My responsibilities included adding new features, identifying and resolving bugs, as well as mentoring new recruits and training users.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set by delving into the following technologies:
Spring Boot: Enhancing my proficiency in backend development.
ReactJS: Broadening my skills in frontend development.
Solidity: Exploring blockchain development.

I'm actively working on adding more projects to my GitHub. Feel free to explore my existing repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities.
